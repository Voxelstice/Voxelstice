# <p align="center">i can code in these programming languages:<p>
- Lua - heard of it because of roblox lua (luau), the first language i ever started learning (actually its luau)
- JavaScript - i started coding in this language when i wanted to make a discord bot, still surprised that this is used for site backends up to this day
- C# - unity is what made me start learning this
