# <p align="center">hello there<p>
<p align="center">i dont know who even does this type of readme thing but i think you might be curious who i am and what i can do<p>

** **

# <p align="center">i can code in programming languages:<p>
- Lua - heard of it because of roblox lua (luau), the first language i ever started learning
- JavaScript - funnily enough this is a language used for backend stuff, i found out about this language when i wanted to code a discord bot
- TypeScript - its kind of the exact same as javascript but i think that's everything to say about typescript
- C# - dont know what to say about this but simply, Unity.

# <p align="center">ok i dont know what else to say about myself soo<p>
<p align="center">feel free to do something else<p>
