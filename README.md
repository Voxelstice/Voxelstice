### hi
i created this github account for a few reasons i wont specify.
** **
### curious on what programming languages i can code in?
Lua. I've been learning lua for 5 years. although i primarily code with LuaU (roblox's edited lua thing).

JavaScript. I used this programming language to code an Discord Bot, well primarily with node.js

### operating systems i use
windows 10 - for the purpose of doing gaming and other stuff that's only windows-compatible
ubuntu (or lets say, linux.) - for doing some stuff in some github repositories.

anyways that is it
feel free to do something else
