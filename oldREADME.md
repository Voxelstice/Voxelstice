<p align="center">you are looking at an procrastinator's profile, who's lazy, sometimes stupid, and dumb.<p>

# <p align="center">curious on what programming languages i can code in? ⌨️<p>
Lua - I've been learning lua for 5 years. although i primarily code with LuaU (roblox's edited lua thing).

JavaScript - I used this programming language to code an Discord Bot, well primarily with node.js

C# - I suffer. Primarily used for Unity stuff.

# <p align="center">operating systems i use 💻<p>
windows 10 - for the purpose of doing gaming and other stuff that's only windows-compatible

ubuntu (or lets say, linux.) - for doing some stuff in some github repositories. 
** **
# <p align="center">anyways that is it 👍<p>
<p align="center">feel free to do something else. there's nothing special about this.<p>
